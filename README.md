# ionic-5-pdf-viewer
Using ngx-pdf-viewer with Ionic 5.

## How to use

I'm assuming you're familiar with node.js and modern JavaScript development.

Clone the repository to an arbitrary directory. Navigate to that directory and run `npm install`.

Now you can start the app with the CLI command `ionic start`. It'll compile the code, start the server, and open a browser with the URL `localhost:8100`.

The PDF file is visible in the second tab.
